**Snappier Server CLI**: v1.3.4a
**FFmpeg**: Latest Stable
**Architecture**: x64 Linux

---

## üéâ Overview

This release focuses on **production reliability**, **observability**, and **robust error handling**. The notification pipeline now features exponential backoff retry logic, structured logging with multiple levels, and comprehensive startup validation. All changes are backward compatible with existing configurations.

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ All tests passing (20/20 notification types)
**Regression Testing**: ‚úÖ Zero regressions from v1.2.8

---

## ‚ú® Major Features

### 1. üîÑ Pushover Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
**Impact**: Eliminates lost notifications due to temporary network issues

- **Automatic retry**: Failed API calls retry up to 3 times (configurable)
- **Exponential backoff**: 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s delays between attempts
- **Error classification**: Handles timeouts, connection errors, and API errors separately
- **Logging**: Detailed retry information for troubleshooting
- **Configuration**:
  ```bash
  NOTIFY_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3        # Number of retries
  NOTIFY_RETRY_DELAY=2           # Initial delay in seconds
  ```

**Benefits**:
- No more silent notification failures
- Better reliability during network fluctuations
- Users can adjust retry strategy for their environment

### 2. üìä Structured Logging System
**Impact**: Dramatically improves debuggability and observability

- **Log levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR with clear separation
- **ISO 8601 timestamps**: Every log entry timestamped to microsecond precision
- **Structured format**: Machine-readable and human-friendly
- **Stderr separation**: Warnings and errors go to stderr for proper log aggregation
- **Runtime configuration**: Set `WEBHOOK_LOG_LEVEL` to control verbosity
- **Configuration**:
  ```bash
  WEBHOOK_LOG_LEVEL=INFO         # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  ```

**Example Output**:
```
[2025-10-26T00:37:25.123456Z] [webhook] [INFO] Pushover credentials configured | user=abc8...4567
[2025-10-26T00:37:26.456789Z] [webhook] [WARNING] Pushover request timeout | retry in 2s (attempt 1/3)
[2025-10-26T00:37:28.789012Z] [webhook] [DEBUG] Catchup event with empty channel | action=catchup_started
```

**Benefits**:
- Production-grade logging for compliance
- Easy filtering by log level
- Better integration with log aggregation systems

### 3. ‚úÖ Startup Credential Validation
**Impact**: Fail-fast on misconfiguration instead of silent failures

- **Validates on startup**: Checks Pushover credentials when webhook starts
- **Clear error messages**: Logs exactly which credential is missing
- **Masked display**: Only shows first/last 4 characters for security
- **Non-blocking**: Allows server to start without Pushover, but warns clearly

**Example**:
```
[2025-10-26T00:37:25.123Z] [webhook] [INFO] Starting webhook server
[2025-10-26T00:37:25.456Z] [webhook] [INFO] Pushover credentials configured | user=abc8...cdef
[2025-10-26T00:37:25.789Z] [webhook] [INFO] Webhook ready for notifications
```

Or if missing:
```
[2025-10-26T00:37:25.123Z] [webhook] [ERROR] PUSHOVER_USER_KEY not set | Notifications will fail
[2025-10-26T00:37:25.456Z] [webhook] [WARNING] Webhook starting without Pushover
```

**Benefits**:
- Users know immediately if configuration is wrong
- No wasted debugging time on silent failures
- Clear guidance on what's missing

### 4. ‚è±Ô∏è Request Timeouts for File Operations
**Impact**: Prevents handler hangs when filesystem is slow/stuck

- **5-second timeout**: On all JSON file operations (EPG, schedules)
- **Signal-based interrupts**: Clean timeout handling without deadlocks
- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to None with appropriate logging
- **Per-operation timeout**: Applies to both EPG cache and schedule JSON loading

**Configuration**:
Hardcoded to 5 seconds (can be adjusted by changing code if needed)

**Benefits**:
- No more hung notification requests
- Protects against slow filesystem, NFS hangs, disk errors
- Request handler stays responsive

### 5. üêõ Catchup Notification Bug Fixes
**Impact**: All catchup notifications now work reliably

- **Empty channel handling**: Fixed falsy operator bug that converted `""` to `None`
- **Payload validation**: Returns HTTP 400 if action field is missing/empty
- **Defensive fallback**: Ensures action field always has a valid value in response
- **Debug logging**: Logs when catchup events have empty channel for troubleshooting

**What was fixed**:
```python
# Before: Empty string became None
channel_hint = payload.get('channel') or payload.get('ch')  # "" ‚Üí None ‚ùå

# After: Empty string preserved
channel_hint = payload.get('channel') if payload and 'channel' in payload else payload.get('ch')  # "" ‚Üí "" ‚úÖ
```

**Benefits**:
- Catchup notifications with missing channel metadata work correctly
- Clear error messages for malformed payloads
- No more "Unknown" action notifications

### 6. üìù Comprehensive Code Documentation
**Impact**: Easier maintenance and contribution

- **Updated README.md**: Extensive documentation with examples and troubleshooting
- **Configuration guide**: All environment variables documented with defaults
- **Architecture diagrams**: Visual representation of notification pipeline
- **Troubleshooting section**: Common issues and solutions
- **Development guide**: How to add custom events, modify behavior
- **example.env**: Fixed and expanded with all new options

---

## üöÄ Migration Guide

### From v1.2.8

No migration required! Just update the image:

```bash
# Pull latest version
docker pull ghcr.io/rydizz214/snappier-server-docker:1.3.4a

# Restart container
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### To Leverage New Features

#### Enable Debug Logging
```bash
# In .env or docker-compose.yml
WEBHOOK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Restart
docker compose restart snappier-server

# View detailed logs
docker compose logs -f snappier-server | grep webhook
```

#### Customize Retry Behavior
```bash
# In .env
NOTIFY_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=5        # More aggressive retry
NOTIFY_RETRY_DELAY=1           # Faster retries for local network

# Or less aggressive
NOTIFY_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=1        # Fail fast
NOTIFY_RETRY_DELAY=5           # Longer delay
```

#### Monitor Startup Health
```bash
# After restart, immediately check logs for credentials validation
docker compose logs snappier-server | head -20

# Should see:
# [webhook] [INFO] Starting webhook server
# [webhook] [INFO] Pushover credentials configured | user=abc8...cdef
```

## üìä Telemetry & Health Checks

New structured logging enables better insights:

```bash
# Check webhook health
curl http://localhost:9080/health | jq .

# Sample output:
{
  "ok": true,
  "api_enabled": true,
  "cache_stats": {
    "epg_hits": 42,
    "epg_misses": 8,
    "https_cache_size": 26,
    "https_probes_total": 26,
    "memory_warnings": 0
  }
}
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Count errors
docker compose logs snappier-server | grep "\[ERROR\]" | wc -l

# See all retries
docker compose logs snappier-server | grep "retry"

# Performance analysis
docker compose logs snappier-server | grep "Pushover sent successfully"
```
